# 100+ challenging Golang programming exercises
Exercises taken from https://github.com/cblte/100-golang-exercises

These challenges come from a file called "100+ Python challenging programming exercises" I found somewhere on the internet. I want to rewrite all exercises for Golang!

I will update the file along with me rewriting the solutions provided in Python. Furthermore, I will also put a file for each solution into a subdirectory, so it can be run locally. Some smaller single file solutions can also be run in the Golang playground (https://play.golang.org).

This is also a training for myself to learn the language and to exercise writing code. I also want to write tests for most of the apps, because I think, tests are always forgotten, and I also should write more tests when writing code.

The exercises for the different levels (see below) are split into the respective files.

But before that, here are the links to the files:

Beginner: exercises_beginner.adoc

Intermediate: exercises_intermediate.adoc

Advanced: exercises_advanced.adoc
